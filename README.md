Street Name Fighting!

see http://streetnamefight.com for a running example.

Look for words which appear in street names to explore toponymic aspects
of cultural values.

For example, in America's streets we have  more Love (806 streets), 
Dreams (400), and Wisdom (141) than Money (119) or Truth (37)
